Secure Domain Accounts & Passwords? Probably Worth [NG]


I first opened the Workstation-Desk and logged on. I went to the Network fileshare tab, clicked on dasShare then opened the "Dynamic Arbitrary Solutions Policy" pdf to get the policies needed.

Then I opened up the Domain-Controller VM and logged on. Once on the Domain-Controller, I opened up Server Manager and went to Group Policy Management. I expanded Forest > daswebs.com > Group Policy Object. Under this folder I created a new GPO called "DasPol". Then I right clicked the newly created GPO and clicked "edit".

Next I clicked on "Computer Configuration" > "Policies" > "Windows Settings" > "Security Settings" > "Account Policies".

Then I changed the Password Policy and Account Lockout Policy according to the pdf I pulled up on Workstation-Desk. 

To link the new GPO to the domain-level I right clicked on the "daswebs.com" domain and selected "Link an Existing GPO...". From there I selected the GPO "DasPol" and hit "Detect Now".
