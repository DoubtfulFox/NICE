Data Backup & Recovery, Definitely Worth Testing

I logged onto the Database VM. First I opened the command prompt as Admin and typed mysql.

Next I went to make a backup using the mysql command line utility that comes installed with MySQL. I entered the command:
>show databases;
This printed out all the MySQL databases. 

Next I wanted to run mysqldump utility. I first need to navigate to where the "mysqldump" application is. I opened another command prompt and entered the following command
>cd \
>cd Program Data\scoop\apps\mysql\5.7.21\bin
>mysqldump -u playerone -p wordpress > wordpress_backup.sql
>[password for playerone]

I verified my backup was creating by opening File Explorer and navigating to:
C:\Program Data\scoop\apps\mysql\4.7.21\bin
At the end of the "bin" folder I saw my backup. 

Next I had to migrate the wordpress_backup.sql database to the Backup server. I booted up the server and navigated to the /var directory. From there I created 2 new subdirectories:
>sudo mkdir /data
>cd /data
>sudo mkdir mysql

Then I navigated to the /var/data/mysql directory.

I went back to the Windows Server and migrated the backup to the Linux Server. I entered the command
>src wordpres_backup.sql root@172.16.30.79:/var/data/mysql

I went back to the Linux Server and verified the sql database transferred.
>ls -l
It has successfully transffered. 

Next I went back to the Backup VM and created a new databased called "wordpresstest"
On the command line I entered the following lines:
>mysql -u root -p
>[entered password for root]
>show databases;
>CREATE DATABASE wordpresstest;
>[ctrl + C]

Now I wanted to restore the "wordpress_backup.sql" database into the newly created "wordpresstest" db.
> mysql -u root -p wordpresstest < wordpress_backup.sql
>[password for root]

I have successfully backedup the wordpress database, transferred it to the Backup server, and restored it into the wordpresstest db.
