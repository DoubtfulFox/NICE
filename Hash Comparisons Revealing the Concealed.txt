Hash Comparisons: Revealing the Concealed


My first objective was to get hashes of all the files in the folder Robby on the E drive (E:\Robby). I did this by opening Windows PowerShell as an Administrator. Then I typed the commands

>cd Documents\HashTools
> md5deep64 -r E:\Robby > C:\all_hashes.txt
>nsrllookup < C:\all_hashes.txt > C:\rds_misses.txt -s security-desk

1) The first command changed me to the directory "HashTools" which is where the tools md5deep and nsrllookup are. 

2) The second command creates a list of all the hashes and corresponding files of the the directory E:\Robby. Then I output the text into a new file called all_hashes.txt on the C: drive.

3) Then I used nsrllookup command to compare the list of hashes (all_hashes.txt) to a NSRL database that contains known good hashes. Any hashes that did not match with the database were output to a file called "rds_misses.txt". I kept getting rejected trying to use the main nsrllookup server so I used the NSRL database server on Security-Desk. The argument "-s security-desk" allowed me to use that database held on that server.

After getting the missed hashes I made a copy of rds_misses.txt and renamed it "hashes.txt" and made sure to save it on the C:\ drive.

End.
