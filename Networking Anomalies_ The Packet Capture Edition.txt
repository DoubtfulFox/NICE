Networking Anomalies: The Packet Capture Edition

The challenge is asking me to look at suspicious packet captures of traffic over the network. Then to flag them on their website for further review later.

First I logged onto the Security-Desk VM and on the Desktop I saw 3 files. 10.7, 20.0, and 30.21 which were all pcap files. They all opened with Wireshark. The website was called "webforms.daswebs.com" which is where I will report my analysis too. 

10.7.pcap
 After opening it, I briefly scrolled through and just kind of looked at how many packets there were, the difference in colors, protocols, re-occurring IP's, etc. Then I clicked on Expert Information under the Analyze tab and Protocol Hierarchy, Conversations, and Endpoints under the Statistics tab. I mostly noticed that IP's 172.16.30.109 and 172.16.10.7 were talking to each other the most with 2,035 packets between them. I decided to check those out a little more closely. Then I noticed that IP 172.16.30.109 was sending mass ARP requests to a wide range of IPs across a network which seemed odd. The first ARP request was at packet #41 and at packet #3088, 172.16.30.109 initiated the TCP-3-way handshake with 172.16.10.7 by sending a SYN connection establish request over port 80. I scrolled to the very bottom of the packet capture file and last saw the suspect IP in packet #6670. The rogue IP is 172.16.30.109 and the range is packets 41-6670.

20.0.pcap
Upon opening this new pcap file I kind of followed a similar thought process in the previous pcap file. Looked at the length, reoccurring IPs, color coding, the Expert Information, etc. Looking at the Expert Information I saw over 2000 SYN connection requests and 2000+ RST/ACK connection reset packets. This definitely seemed odd. IPs 172.16.30.9, 172.16.20.2, and 172.16.20.4 all had have some relationship. 172.16.30.109 initiated SYN connection request with 172.16.20.2 and 172.16.20.4 replied with SYN/ACK. Then 172.16.30.109 proceeded to mass spam 172.16.20.2 with SYN requests and 172.16.20.4 kept sending RST/ACK. This to me seemed like IP 172.16.30.109 was trying to bring down a server with SYN flooding? I flagged IP 172.16.30.109 as malicious, and I first saw that IP at packet 77 and last saw it at 8801.

30.21
Again, same process went into this one. I saw IP 172.16.30.109 was sending thousands of ARP requests similar to 10.7.pcap. Then I noticed 172.16.30.109 connected with 172.6.30.21 at packet 7601. They began communicating over SSH for a while and eventually at packet 8186 the connection was finished between them. I flagged IP 172.16.30.109 as malicious starting from packet 963-8186.
