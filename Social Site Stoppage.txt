Social Site Stoppage

I logged onto the Domain-Controller and opened up Server Manager. I then clicked on Tools>DNS. I expanded AD then opened Forward Lookup Zones. I right clicked on this and selected "New Zone...". 

This opened the New Zone Wizard. 
-I clicked Next
-Primary zone
 -"To all DNS servers running on domain controllers in this domain: daswebs.com
-I named the zone youtube.com
-Do not allow dynamic updates
-Finish

Once my new zone was made I expanded it and right clicked on youtube.com>New Host (A or AAAA)....
Then in the New Host menu, I changed the IP address to 0.0.0.0 and clicked Add Host. 

I did the same steps for twitter.com, instagram.com, and facebook.com. After making the 4 zones and adding new hosts, I then right clicked on Forward Lookup Zones>Refresh.

This concludes the lab.
