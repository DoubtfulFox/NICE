Disguising a Dastardly Deed with Disappeared Data

PART I:

I am tasked with decrypting and unzipping the contents in the "exfiltratroll.zip" archive. 

I first booted up the Workstation-Desk and opened File Explorer. I navigated to the "E:\Ione" and saw encrypted archive "exfiltratroll.zip". The zip archive was locked with a password. I wanted to use decryption tools to assist in opening this archive.

In order to open the zip archive, I will need to crack the encryption. To do so I will use "pkcrack". I booted up the Security-Desk VM and logged in.

Next, on the Workstation-Desk I opened firefox and downloaded FileZilla from "https://filezilla-project.org". After installing FileZilla, I opened the program. To transfer files from Windows to Kali, I gave input on the Host, Username, and Password fields then hit "Quickconnect".

Host: sftp://playerone@172.16.30.6
Username: playerone
Password: password123

After connecting to Kali through FileZilla, I then expanded E:\Ione and dragged the "exfiltratroll.zip" archive over to Kali and placed it on the "Desktop" directory.

PART II:
Updating Kali and Downloading/Installing CMAKE and PKCRACK

Next on the Kali VM, I ran the command:
>sudo apt-get update

Then I downloaded and installed CMAKE 
>sudo apt show cmake
>sudo apt install cmake g++ make 

Then I installed pkcrack
>git clone https://github.com/keyunluo/pkcrack
>mkdir pkcrack/build
>cd pkcrack/build
>cmake ..
>make

PART III:
Understanding PKCRACK

First, knowing how PKCRACK works is important. PKCRACK is a Known-Plaintext Attack (KPA). You must know the contents of one the files that is in the compressed, encrypted archive. When observing the contents of the "exfiltratroll.zip" archive on E:\Ione, I noticed there was a file called "astral.jpg". Inside of the folder "Ione" there is a file also called "astral.jpg" that is unencrypted. This is the key to solving this challenge. We have our known-plaintext file that we need. 
In order to condense this information down, PKCRACK relies on 4 inputs: the encrypted archive (exfiltratroll.zip), the known-plaintext file inside of the encrypted archive (astral.jpg), an unencrypted archive (KnowFile.zip), and the known-plaintext file in the unencrypted archive (astral.jpg).

1) Now letâ€™s go back to Workstation-Desk, open FileZilla and drag the "astral.jpg" file over to Kali and drop it in the "Desktop" directory.

2)Now we are going to create an archive and put "astral.jpg" in it.
Go to the Security-Desk VM and open up a terminal and type in the command: (be in the Desktop directory):
>7z a KnownFile.zip astral.jpg

 PART IV:
Running PKCRACK

1)Navigate to pkcrack/demo directory:
>cd ..
>cd pkcrack/demo
(full pathway: /home/playerone/pkcrack/demo)

2)Run pkcrack
The command context is:
 pkcrack -C encrypted-ZIP -c ciphertextname -P plaintext-ZIP -p plaintextname -d decrypted_file -a

3)Here is what I actually entered in the terminal:
>sudo ../bin/pkcrack -C /home/playerone/Desktop/exfiltratroll.zip -c astral.jpg -P /home/playerone/Desktop/KnowFile.zip -p astral.jpg -d /home/playerone/Desktop/REVEALED -a
	
	-C is the pathway to the encrypted.zip folder
	-c is the name of the file that we know the contents of (no pathway) in the encrypted arhcive
	-P is the pathway to the unencrypted.zip archive with the known-plaintext file
	-p is the name of the file that we know the contents of (no pathway) in the unencrypted archive
	-d outputs the contents of the encryped.zip archive into an unencrypted zip archive
	-a .... not sure what this flag does but it's required

4)After successfuly running pkcrack an archive will be made. I called it "RVEALED". It will be in the Desktop directory.
5)Go to the Desktop directory and extract the contents from the "REVEALED" archive.
	- this will display the 3 jpgs and 1 text file that were previously password protected.

PART V:
Returning the files back to Workstation-Desk

1) Go back to the Workstation-Desk VM and open FileZilla. Reconnect if you closed out, otherwise refresh the program using the refresh symbol.
2)On the Security-Desk workstation we can open the Desktop folder and see the 4 new files. Drag and drop them onto the C:\ drive on the Workstation-Desk.
