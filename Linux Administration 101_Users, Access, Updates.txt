Linux Administration 101: Users, Access & Updates

1) Make Gary Thatcher a user account on the Prod-Web server and name him "gthatcher".

First we booted up the Prod-Web server and logged on. Then we entered the command 
>sudo adduser gthatcher

2) Give the new account sudo or admin privileges.

We did this by editing the visudo file and adding gthatcher to it. We typed the following commands:
>sudo visudo

This opened the visudo file. We scroll to the bottom and added the following line to the file:
>gthatcher ALL=(ALL) ALL

We saved the file by hitting <esc> then typing:    :wq

3) Now we need to update Apache web server. This was done by using the command:
>sudo yum update

End
