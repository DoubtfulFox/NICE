Linux Administration 201: 101 + Network Integration

I am tasked with setting up a workstation and creating a user profile for an individual.
First I booted up the Security-Desk VM and logged in as playerone.

1) Change hostname to SecConsultantKali 
   #sudo hostnamectl set-hostname SecConsultantKali.daswebs.com

2) Change the hostname in /etc/hosts file
   #sudo vi /etc/hosts
    - type "i" to edit text. Comment out line "172.0.1.1 security-desk.daswebs.com	            security-desk" by preceding it with a "#"
    - add the following text:
   >127.0.0.1 SecConsultantKali.daswebs.com	SecConsultantKali
    - Save and quit by hitting "Esc" and typing ":wq"

3)  Add the DNS server to the local machine
   #lsattr /etc/resolv.conf
   #chattr -ie /etc/resolv.conf
   #sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf
    - edit the file by typing "i". Edit the first line to "nameserver 172.16.30.5"
    -Save and quit by hitting "Esc" and typing ":wq"
 
4) Set the IP address and subnet mask
   #ifconfig
   #sudo ifconfig eth0 up
   #sudo ip addr add 172.16.30.6/24 dev eth0
   #ifconfig

5) Set the Default Gateway
   #sudo ip route add default via 172.16.30.2 dev eth0

6) Adding a DNS entry to the Domain Controller
   - Boot up the Domain-Controller VM and log in as playerone.
   a) Open Server Manager>Tools>DNS
   b) Expand AD>Forward Lookup Zones>daswebs.com
   c) Open daswebs.com and right click in the blank space and select "New Host (A or AAAA)..."
   d)In the New Host window, set the Name to "SecConsultantKali" and set the IP address to 172.16.30.6
   e) Then click Apply and OK.

7) Creating the new account with home directory
   #sudo useradd -m drandolph
   #sudo passwd drandolph
   >root
   >root

8) Giving the new account sudo privilage
   #sudo visudo
   - This opens the sudo file. Scroll to the bottom, type "i" to go into insert mode and add the text:
   >drandolph ALL=(ALL) ALL
   - Save and exit


9) Change shell to bash
   #sudo chmod 777 /etc/passwd
   #sudo vi /etc/passwd
   - Scroll to the bottom of the file until we get to "drandolph" and edit the last part of the line after the last "/" symbol to say "bash" instead of "sh"
    -Save and exit
     

FINISH
