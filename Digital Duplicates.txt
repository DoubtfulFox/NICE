Digital Duplicates


First I opened Security-Desk workstation. I needed to know what unmounted drive was called. On the Desktop, I opened File Sysem. On the left menu, under Devices I saw "File System" and "261 MB Volume". I hovered my mouse over it and it was called /dev/sda. I had a feeling this was the unmounted drive I was looking for but to double check I opened a terminal and ran a command.

>lsblk

This command printed out all drives, mounted or unmounted. This again reaffirmed that the drive I am looking for is /dev/sda.

Next I needed to check if the directory "/forensicimages" is already made. If not, I need to make a directory called "forensicimages" and then make an image of the drive using the "dd" command and name the image "forensicimage.dd".

>cd /
>ls /
>sudo mkdir forensicimages
>cd forensicimages
>sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=forensicimage.dd
> ls

Now I needed to make SHA512 hashes of both the drive and of the forensicimages.dd file.

> sudo sha512sum /dev/sda > drivehash.txt
>sudo sha512sum orforensicimage.dd > forsensicimage_hash.txt
>ls

Now I need to verify the hashes are the same.

>sudo apt install dcfldd
>sudo dcfldd if=drive_hash.txt vf=forensicimage_hash.txt

OR I can use a text editor command to verify. The Vimdiff command will highlight the differences in text.

>vimdiff forensicimage_hash.txt drive_hash.txtvi
#With this command, you must scroll right to the end to see all of the text. To exit you must use:
>:q!
>:q!


End
